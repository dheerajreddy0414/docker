Hi

My Name is Dheeraj Reddy Jonnalagadda and My Majors is MSCS

Currently i work at APPLE as a Devops Engineer for Apple Pay Department. I have been with Apple for last 3 years. I found the job through a referral and after going through couple of rounds of interviews i was able to get the job and started working here. I love what i do at apple right now, since it allows to interact with various people from different backgrounds.

Love being part of this college and community

 

Regards

DJ (Dheeraj)
